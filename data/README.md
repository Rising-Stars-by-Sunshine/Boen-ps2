# Twibot-22 Sample Dataset

This folder contains a subset of the **Twibot-22** dataset, which is a large-scale benchmark for Twitter bot detection. The original dataset, introduced by **Feng et al. (2022)**, provides a comprehensive collection of Twitter user profiles, social connections, and bot/human annotations to facilitate research on bot detection using graph-based and machine learning approaches.

Due to the large size of Twibot-22, this sample includes **1,000 users**, preserving key user attributes, social relationships, and labels. The dataset aims to help researchers experiment with bot detection models without requiring extensive computing resources. The full dataset and its details can be found in the paper:

## ðŸ”„ Preprocessing and Harmonization Steps

To ensure data consistency and usability, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

1. **Filtering Users**:  
   - Selected a **balanced subset of 1,000 users**, ensuring diversity in bot/human distribution.
   - Removed inactive or deleted accounts from the original dataset.

2. **Graph Structure Processing**:  
   - Extracted relevant social relationships (e.g., follows, retweets, mentions).
   - Constructed an edge list (`edge_sample.csv`) to facilitate network analysis.

This dataset serves as a basis for evaluating Twitter bot detection models.
